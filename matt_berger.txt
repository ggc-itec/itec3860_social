Hello guys! 

My name is Matthew Berger.

I am a senior and graduating Fall 2015.

I love brewing beer with my twin brother Nathan. Definitely a fan of high gravity stouts and hoppy ipa's. Furthermore, I love playing role playing games like Dragon Age Inquisition and tell tale game like The Wolf Among Us on the playstation 4. 

My favorite food is thai curry, vietnamese pho, and just smoked salmon. I also have an obsession with apples and carrots. 

Favorite Netflix Movie: THE HOBBIT

I love my dog Charlie
